    "description = \"Around 2015 I wanted to play a tabletop game like D&D; I read through multiple editions but all of them seemed quite clunky, they also seemed strangely restrictive, so having never actually played D&D or anything similar I decided to develop a tabletop game of my own. //I made classes, creatures, game and combat mechanics, character sheets, set it in space, and wrote a brief lore. I wanted to play whilst being the DM, so I made sure a lot of the game and npc decisions were based off dice rolls - leaving everything up to RNGesus. //The game worked for the most part, but I only ever played half a session of it with three other people, and I still haven't played D&D to this day. But little did I know, that this budding RPG would eventually evolve into a more sophisticated and complex conception many years later.\"\n",

Even now, it's difficult to be excited or interested in a new game on the horizon - scummy publishers, false promises, all-too-effective marketing, over-casualising franchises, and so on, it all leaves me disappointed once the game has finally released. So, using newfound python skills which I trained up in the 2020 lockdown, I dreamt of a game I REALLY, REALLY wanted to play; it had the same giddy and rewarding feeling my tabletop game had, and so I was instantly reminded of it. //I dug up all of the assets and spreadsheets and dove into a coding frenzy.
