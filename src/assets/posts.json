    "description": "Around 2015 I wanted to play a tabletop game like D&D; I read through multiple editions but all of them seemed quite clunky, they also seemed strangely restrictive, so having never actually played D&D or anything similar I decided to develop a tabletop game of my own. I made classes, creatures, game and combat mechanics, character sheets, set it in space, and wrote a brief lore. I wanted to play whilst being the DM, so I made sure a lot of the game and npc decisions were based off dice rolls - leaving everything up to RNGesus. The game worked for the most part, but I only ever played half a session of it with three other people, and I still haven't played D&D to this day. But little did I know, that this budding RPG would eventually evolve into a more sophisticated and complex conception many years later."
