        "description": "Around 2015 I wanted to play a tabletop game like D&D; I read through multiple editions but all of them seemed quite clunky, they also seemed strangely restrictive, so having never actually played D&D or anything similar I decided to develop a tabletop game of my own. //I made classes, creatures, game and combat mechanics, character sheets, set it in space, and wrote a brief lore. I wanted to play whilst being the DM, so I made sure a lot of the game and npc decisions were based off dice rolls - leaving everything up to RNGesus. //The game worked for the most part, but I only ever played half a session of it with three other people, and I still haven't played D&D to this day. But little did I know, that this budding RPG would eventually evolve into a more sophisticated and complex conception many years later."

        "description": "Gaming from around 2014 onwards left me quite starved. Even now, it's difficult to be excited or interested in a new game on the horizon - scummy publishers, false promises, all-too-effective marketing, over-casualising franchises, and so on, it all leaves me disappointed once the game has finally released. So, using newfound python skills which I trained up in the 2020 lockdown, I dreamt of a game I REALLY, REALLY wanted to play; it had the same giddy and rewarding feeling my tabletop game had, and so I was instantly reminded of it. //I dug up all of the assets and spreadsheets and dove into a coding frenzy. This initial series of posts is an understatement of what happened in those first few months."

        "description": "I hadn't planned on making a fully-fledged game, but then I found out about Godot. After some research and practice, I realised that it wasn't so far out to connect everything in a proper game engine and have at least basic rendering and sprites. I started making little pixel people (...I made slimes...) and test assets to practice. //Visually, the goal is something resembling Pokemon-meets-RuneScape, with a game loop similar to Oblivion-meets-Diablo, kind of. After a bit more practice, I realised that if I got really serious about this as an even longer-term side project, then I could make a very interesting game of quality that maybe even others could enjoy!"

There are also species abilities and weapons if applicable. Everything mentioned generates correctly and seems to work in combat, although further testing is necessary. //As well as this enemies can decide to cast magic! In combat, the enemies potentially spawn in groups and have a working AI which decides what movement and actions they do! A few fun things; enemies can group buff, they can spawn with special elemental resistances (and 3 magnitudes for those resistances)."

All of this will happen later in production. Map tiles also need to be designed and created, which will be a challenge in itself as I must make sure the art style and theme resonates well with the game's setting!"

I'll give a free copy of the game upon release to the first person who could guess all 10, just tweet them at me, and I'll give clues down the line (think space-related). //Also, there are over 80 different materials and over 40 different weapon forms. Characters not only have magic master, but also mastery within an element. Characters can also specialise in different types of weapons, eg. bladed, 1-handed, etc."

The next stage would be to check the profiles of the creatures and enemies during each phase to make sure that buffs, debuffs, and general ongoing effects are working. //Interestingly, porting the game to the Godot Engine with basic sprites and visuals may actually aid this - I was thinking that a basic port would be the next step anyway. I will reflect on the current game's overview some more and think of what the next best steps are - I'm using a ticket board to keep track of everything I'm doing and everything that needs to be done, so let's see what happens - I'll update this log with any happenings!"

It may already be completely working, but only some more testing will truly tell. Logic-wise we're at the cusp of the Alpha stage, design-wise, final static (non-animated) sprites are needed for reaching pre-Alpha first - with basic animations and FX throwing us into Alpha.
