Live Dev Log: https://rimichaeru.github.io/rpg-dev-log/ 

This is the development log for my Python-Godot in-depth RPG, with the Dev Log itself being built with React.

This is a heavily-based RNG RPG which draws upon many character and item profiles to then further randomise into unique creations. Progression is much like Diablo whilst the aesthetic is more like Pokemon meets RuneScape!

#### Setting

The RPG (name to be determined) is set in a fantasy-futuristic universe where players can customise their character in traditional RPG ways, yet also fight aliens and strange creatures from the beyond.

#### Background

I wanted to play a game which left you excited for the next drop each time you walked away from it. So, with an odd lack of these games on the market, I decided to make it myself. My aim is not to create convoluted game systems with the *appearance* of complexity, but to introduce meaningful depth which allows you to progress your character from lemon to demi-god with strong challenges and build decisions along the way.

#### Style

The game is in a 2D pixel format, and although this can be charming, the vital charm of the game will be in its sheer item and creature diversity alongside interesting & engaging combat and progression sytems.

*I hope you tune in, get connected, and join us on the journey!*
